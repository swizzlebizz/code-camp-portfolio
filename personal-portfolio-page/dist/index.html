      <h1>&nbsp; About Me</h1>
    <p2>I am a former medic of 13 years who is trying to branch into a new career from scratch. Although I am self-taught, there are many things that give me a competitive edge in the job force. Primarily, my ability to catch errors and provide detailed documentation. I am grateful that I stumbled upon freeCodeCamp, because I have three kids and time is scarce (I actually wake up two hours before them to make sure this time is carved out). I have also been completing these courses with any free time I have; some moms surf Pintrest and drink tea, I read code languages and chug coffee with my blue-blockers on. I like to believe that I am a quick learner. I typically have a profound understanding of languages, I can read and understand Spanish near-fluent, as well as German, and ASL. I learned all of these languages in a short span of time to adapat to a situation, whether medical, or family. In addition to this, being in the medical field for so long has given me the sueprpower of professional patience, and the ability to triage situations according to time and priority. I don't get rattled easily, and it is in my nature to accept and understand constructive critism. You want a pretty, functioning website? I got you, fam. The customer wants to make changes while we're in the middle of a sprint? Where do you need me? <br><br> I want a better way to provide for my family. Although I loved helping people, it does not pay nearly enough to support myself, let alone a husband and three kids. The entire reason I actually delved into this world was based entirely upon my husband working his way up to becoming a DEV with zero experience. He works really hard, and i'd like to contribute more. My hope is that, when I complete this camp, people willl look at my work and see that I am capable of great things. <!--once I can get my stupid projet to work-->This has been a frustrating and fun journey that I hope to continue.</p2>

    <h1>&nbsp;Goals</h1>
    <p2>My goal for now is to get hired on as a QA tester, so I can continue learning and gain a better understanding of DEV work itself. If there was a feasible way to be hired for remote work, that would be my ideal situation. I'm a goofy nerd with drive- the best kind of people. I am currently working towards completing this code camp by August, and having 4 complete projects that fully demonstrate my capabilities in the same time period. I know that I will succeed. However, I am keenly aware that in this industry- actions speak louder than words. I <em>will</em> be the loudest.</p2>
